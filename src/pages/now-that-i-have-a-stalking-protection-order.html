          A protection order does not guarantee your safety, and it does not guarantee the stalking behavior will stop. It is essential that you continue to be vigilant and take steps to ensure your safety.

          <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
            <p>If you think that you or someone you know is being stalked, we encourage you to follow the “STEPS” action plan created by the Stalking Resource Center to engage in active and ongoing safety planning:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><u>S</u>ee it (and acknowledge it as stalking)</li>
              <li><u>T</u>hreat Assessment</li>
              <li><u>E</u>vidence Collection</li>
              <li><u>P</u>rotection</li>
              <li>Support</li>
            </ol>

          <a href="#" class="accordion-title">2. Ensure the Stalking Protection Order was served</a>
          <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
            <p>The sooner the Stalking Protection Order is served on the respondent, and a Return of Service is filed with the court, the sooner the Order can be enforced if the stalker violates it.</p>
            <p>To check on the status of service, call the law enforcement agency responsible for service to see if the respondent has been served. You can also contact the court where the Order was filed to see if the Return of Service has been filed. You can also register to get notified of service through an automated protective order notification system called <a href="http://www.waspc.org/protective-order-notification-savinpo-">SAVIN Protective Order (SAVIN PO)</a> although sometimes there are delays with notification.</p>
            <p>Once the order has been served be sure to call the police to report any violations of the order.</p>

          <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
            <ol>
              <li>Make sure you always have a copy of your order on you.  It’s a good idea to give copies to trusted family and friends, or those who might need to call the police to help enforce the order (i.e. employer, landlord).</li>
              <li>Request as many free certified copies of the stalking protection order as you need when you file the order with the court. You can also come back to the courthouse to get extra copies if needed.</li>
              <li>Keep extra copies with you at all times, at home and in your car.</li>
              <li>When going to court, make a plan for being as safe as possible there. Ask the court what safety options are available for you at the courthouse.</li>
