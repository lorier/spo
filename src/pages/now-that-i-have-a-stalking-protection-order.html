          A protection order does not guarantee your safety, and it does not guarantee the stalking behavior will stop. It is essential that you continue to be vigilant and take steps to ensure your safety.

      <h2>Your 10-point Plan for Safety</h2>
      <ul class="accordion" data-accordion data-multi-expand="true" data-allow-all-closed="true">
        <li class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>
          <a href="#" class="accordion-title">1. Ensure the order is served</a>
          <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
            <p>The sooner the order is served on the respondent, and a Return of Service is filed with the court, the sooner theorder can be enforced if the stalker violates it.</p>
            <p>To check on the status of service,  call the law enforcement agency responsible for service to see if the respondent has been served. You can also register to get notified of service through an automated protective order notification system called SAVINPO http://www.waspc.org/protective-order-notification-savinpo- although sometimes there are delays with notification.</p>
            <p>Once the order has been served be sure to call the police to report any violations of the order.</p>

          <a href="#" class="accordion-title">2. Stay Organized</a>
          <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
            <p>Make sure you always have a copy of your order on you, and it’s a good idea to give copies to other people. Request as many free certified copies of the protection order as you need when you file the order with the court. You can also come back to the courthouse to get extra copies if needed.</p>
            <p>Who should have a copy:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Anyone who may need to enforce the restrictions on the order</li>
              <li>Anyone who may need to call the police (911)</li>
              <li>Keep extra copies at home</li>
              <li>Keep extra copies in your car</li>
            </ul>
