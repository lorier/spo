      <h3>What to Expect</h3>
        <p>This is a legally binding process, and there are several steps involved, but there are people and resources that can help guide you through each part of the process. </p>
        <p>Plan to spend 2-3 hours in court when you go to file your protection order. If you have children, try to arrange childcare so that you will have the time and emotional energy you need to complete the paperwork</p>
