      <div class="callout"><h3>Stalking is</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>A pattern of unwanted behavior</strong> that involves monitoring, harassing, repeatedly contacting or following another person;</li>
          <li><strong>That would cause a reasonable person to feel frightened, threatened or intimidated</strong>; and actually causes these reactions in the person being contacted, monitored, harassed or followed.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <p><strong>It does not matter if the stalker <em>intends</em> to frighten, intimidate or threaten</strong> someone, as long as the stalker knows that such behavior could cause a reasonable person to feel frightened, intimidated or threatened.</p>
      <p><strong>Stalking is a “course of conduct,” meaning it involves repeated, continuous behavior</strong>. Unwanted behaviors may not seem that alarming if considered separately as single incidents, but when the <em>pattern</em> of behaviors is considered altogether and over time, stalking becomes apparent and alarming.</p>

        <h3>Cyberstalking</h3>  Cyberstalking is a form of stalking that specifically involves unwanted, harassing or threatening <strong>electronic or online communication or tracking</strong>.  It may include the use of the internet, an electronic device (such as a cell phone, spyware, or a GPS tracker) or a social media platform (such as Facebook or Twitter) to: monitor, harass or threaten another person: spy, track or gather information on another person; and/or disclose intimate or embarrassing images of or information about another person.  The crime of cyberstalking does not require a pattern of behavior like the crime of stalking – a single incident can constitute cyberstalking under Washington State law. </p>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <h3>What Stalking Looks Like</h3>
      <p>Because it seems extreme, many do not think to call what they are experiencing “stalking,” but may describe stalking behaviors including:</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="large-3 columns">
          <p><strong>Surveillance</strong></br>Following, showing up, spying, using technology to keep tabs on someone</p>
        </div>
        <div class="large-3 columns">
          <p><strong>Life Invasion</strong><br/>Repeated unwanted contact in person or by phone, social media, text, email, card/note, gifts, messages, or through others</p>
        </div>
        <div class="large-3 columns">
          <p><strong>Intimidation</strong><br/>Implcit and explicit threats, third party threats, forced confrontations, property damage, or threatened suicide</p>
        </div>
        <div class="large-3 columns">
          <p><strong>Interference and Disruption </strong>of someone’s life professionally, socially and personally.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <h3>Some things stalkers do</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Follow you or show up wherever you are</li>
        <li>Send unwanted gifts, letters, cards, or e-mails</li>
        <li>Damage your home, car, or other property</li>
        <li>Monitor phone calls or computer use</li>
        <li>Use technology, like spyware, cameras or GPS to track you</li>
        <li>Threaten to disclose intimate images of you (sometimes called “revenge porn”)</li>
        <li>Drive by or hang out at or near your home, school, or work</li>
        <li>Threaten to hurt you, your family, friends, or pets</li>
        <li>Find information about you by using public records, online search services, spyware, investigators, or by contacting friends, family, neighbors, or co-workers</li>
        <li>Post information or spread rumors about you on the Internet, in a public place, or by word of mouth</li>
        <li>Other actions that control, track, or frighten</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Identifying a stalker</h3>
      <p>A stalker can be someone you know well or not at all.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>More often than not, people are stalked by their current or former intimate partners</strong>. If your stalker is a current or ex- partner, spouse, someone with whom you have children, family or household member, or even a current or former roommate, your relationship qualifies you for a different type of protection that specifically addresses domestic violence.  Please <a href="http://www.protectionorder.org/" target="_blank">see protectionorder.org</a> for more information.</li>
        <li><strong>A stalker can also be a stranger or an acquaintance,</strong> such as a co-worker, fellow student, someone you met online or who found you online, or someone you encounter during daily routines (e.g. at the bus stop, coffee shop, store, school, gym, etc.).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Understanding Stalking and Other Unwanted Behaviors</h3>
      <p>It’s important to distinguish between different types of stalking and other unwanted behaviors because it determines what kinds of legal protections may be available to you and what course of action to pursue. Here are some <a class="pink" href="file:///C:/Users/orcuttt/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Temporary Internet Files/Content.Outlook/IG8X5FB7/Stalking scenarios.docx" target="_blank">scenarios</a> that may help you determine your options.

            <p>There are resources available that can help you recognize and get help with what is happening. Here is a helpful <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cdar.uky.edu/CoerciveControl/docs/Stalking Connecting the Dots_Victim.pdf">tip sheet</a> for recognizing stalking safety issues. An online tool called the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cdar.uky.edu/CoerciveControl/sharp.html">Stalking and Harassment Assessment Risk Profile (SHARP)</a> can help you get a better sense of your situation. It takes roughly 15-20 minutes to complete, is research-based and can help you determine next steps you may want to take to increase your safety.</p></div>

            <a href="#" class="accordion-title">How is Stalking Different from Harassment?</a> <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
            <p>Stalking can look like harassment at first but it’s actually different. <a target="_blank" href="http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=10.14.020">Harassment</a> involves unwanted contact that seriously annoys or alarms someone,  causes them emotional distress, and can involve a single incident.</p>
            <p>Stalking, on the other hand, involves a <strong><em>pattern</em></strong> of <strong><em>repeated</em></strong> unwanted behavior (two or more incidents) committed over time that causes fear. If you feel you are being harassed, you can file for an <a target="_blank" href="http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=10.14.080">Anti-harassment Order</a>. The petition for an Anti-harassment Order and Stalking Protection Order are actually the same petition and paperwork: the court will decide which type of order best fits your situation.</p></div>

            <a href="#" class="accordion-title">How is Stalking Different from Cyberstalking?</a> <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
            <p>Cyberstalking is a form of stalking but is its own crime under the law. Someone can stalk a person by using electronic devices and online technologies rather than physically or in person. <a target="_blank" href="http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.61.260">Cyberstalking</a>, sometimes called “online abuse,” occurs when an individual uses the internet or other electronic means to stalk or harass another person.</p>
            <p>Cyberstalking may include monitoring, threats, solicitation for sex, disclosing intimate images of someone, using spyware, using social media or gathering information that may be used to threaten or harass. Cyberstalking is a crime that is indeed on the rise as technology improves and becomes more accessible. If you are a victim of cyberstalking you may apply for a Stalking Protection Order.</p></div>

            <a href="#" class="accordion-title">What if my stalker is someone I’ve been in a relationship with, or a family member?</a> <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
            <p>If you are being stalked by a spouse or intimate partner, or someone you date or used to date, or someone with whom you have a child, a roommate or former roommate, or a family member, you should seek protection in the form of a <a target="_blank" href="http://protectionorder.org/">Domestic Violence Protection Order</a>.

            <a href="#" class="accordion-title">What about Bullying?</a> <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
            <p>Bullying is a type of harassment, commonly seen in school settings or with young people that can involve in-person or electronic intimidation, cruel teasing, humiliation and threats. It can be repeated, like stalking, or it may only occur one time. If the bullying you are experiencing is causing you distress, you may consider filing for an <a target="_blank" href="http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=10.14.070">Anti-harassment Order</a>, or if the behavior is repeated or part of a pattern causing fear, you may consider filing for a Stalking Protection Order.

        <h2>Preserving Evidence</h2>
        <h3>Documenting Stalking Incidents and Behavior</h3>

        <p>Whether or not you choose to petition for a Stalking Protection Order, documenting the stalking behavior is strongly recommended.  Documenting incidents of stalking can be overwhelming.  Because stalking involves multiple incidents, it is important to document each incident of stalking behavior in as much detail as possible. <a href="#" class="pink">Tracking the Stalker</a> tips and a <a href="#" class="pink">stalking incident log</a> (hyperlink) can be helpful for detailing each incident. </p>

        <p>Often stalking logs are helpful in making police reports and can become evidence in a stalking case.  IT IS IMPORTANT <em>not</em> to include any new personal information that the stalker could learn in your stalking incident log.  If the log were to become evidence in a criminal case, it would be made part of a public record and the stalker would likely be allowed to review the log as part of the discovery process.  Do not record information you want to remain confidential.</p>

        <h4>TIPS for documenting stalking:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Call the police to report each incident of stalking and/or violations of a protection order</li>
          <li>Take a picture of each police incident report/patrol officer’s card.  Other patrol will write the incident report number on their business card.  This will be helpful for obtaining copies of reports and referencing the reports for your protection order/detective follow up.</li>
          <li>Keep all text messages, emails and voicemail messages from the stalker.  Do not delete this important electronic evidence!</li>
          <li>If you receive unwanted mail or gifts, save everything for possible detective follow-up and collection by law enforcement.</li>
          <li>If the stalking involved unwanted social media contact, do not immediately delete your accounts.  Contact the police for assistance in collecting the evidence.  You may want to take a screen shot of each contact.</li>
          <li>If you receive unwanted phone calls, document how many calls you receive and the time of the calls.</li>
          <li>If family members of friends are also being harassed or have witnessed stalking incidents, document the witnesses’ names and times of contact.</li>
          <li>If your property (car or home) are being vandalized/damaged, take pictures of the damaged property and call the police.</li>
        </ol>

          <h2>Why It’s a Big Deal</h2>
          <h3>Stalking is a community concern.</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>7.5 million people are stalked in one year in the U.S. </li>
            <li>An estimated 15 percent of women and 6 percent of men have been a victim of stalking during their lifetimes</li>
            <li>61 percent of female victims and 44 percent of male victims were stalked by a current or former intimate partner</li>
            <li>25% of female victims and 32% of male victims are stalked by an acquaintance</li>
          </ul>
          <p>People react in all sorts of ways to stalking, from minimizing it to experiencing much fear and stress. Being stalked can take a big toll on someone. It can lead a person to feel a loss of control over their life and a loss of their autonomy and privacy. Many experience high anxiety, distress and/ or fear, hypervigilance, worry that it’s never going to end or that no one else thinks it’s that serious. It can lead to health concerns, difficulty concentrating, time lost at work, and can create financial troubles.</p>
          <div class="callout"><p class="intro-text">It is important to remember that Stalking is a crime.
          IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT it is happening to you.</p></div>
          <p><strong>We encourage you to:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>See it and acknowledge it as stalking</strong> (the <a href="http://www.cdar.uky.edu/CoerciveControl/sharp.html">SHARP</a> can help here)</li>
            <li><strong>Plan ahead for your safety</strong> by thinking about the specific threats you may face and vulnerabilities you may have. Think ahead about what you can do in specific situations, particularly if the stalker shows up unexpectedly, so that you can be prepared.  Practice things you might say or do to avoid or escape a dangerous situation.  Ask people you trust to watch out for you and help you stay safe.</li>
            <li><strong>Preserve evidence and document</strong> the stalking behaviors. See (<a href="#" class="pink">Tracking the Stalker PDF</a>) and a <a href="http://www.victimsofcrime.org/docs/src/stalking-incident-log_pdf.pdf?sfvrsn=4">sample stalking log</a></li>
