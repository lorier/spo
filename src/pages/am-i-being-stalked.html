      <div class="callout"><h3>Stalking is: </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A pattern of unwanted behavior that involves monitoring, harassing, repeatedly contacting or following another person ;</li>
          <li>That would cause a reasonable person to feel frightened, threatened or intimidated; and actually causes these reactions in the person being contacted, monitored, harassed or followed.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        
      <p>It does not matter if the stalker intends to frighten, intimidate or threaten someone, as long as the stalker knows that such behavior could cause a reasonable person to feel frightened, intimidated or threatened.</p>
      <p>Stalking is a “course of conduct,” meaning it involves repeated, continuous behavior. Unwanted behaviors may not seem that alarming if considered separately as single incidents, but when the pattern of behaviors is considered altogether and over time, stalking becomes apparent and alarming.</p>

      </div>
      <h3>Identifying a stalker:</h3>
      <p>A stalker can be someone you know well or not at all.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>More often than not, people are stalked by their current or former intimate partners. If your stalker is a current or ex- partner, spouse, someone with whom you have children, family or household member, or even a current or former roommate, your relationship qualifies you for a different type of protection that specifically addresses domestic violence. As such, this website does not apply to you – instead, please see protectionorder.org for the information you need.</li>
        <li>A stalker can also be a stranger, co-worker, acquaintance, fellow student, someone you met online or who found you online, or someone you encounter during daily routines (e.g. at the bus stop, coffee shop, store, school, gym, etc.). If you are being stalked by someone </li>

      <h3>Understanding Stalking and Other Unwanted Behaviors</h3>
      <p>It’s important to distinguish between different types of stalking and other unwanted behaviors because it determines what kinds of legal protections may be available to you and what course of action you should pursue. Here are some scenarios that may help you determine your options.

          <a href="#" class="accordion-title">Maybe I’m overreacting... or maybe I’m in more danger than I realize... How can I get a better sense of my situation?</a> 
          <div class="accordion-content content active" data-tab-content>
            <p>There are resources available that can help you recognize and get help with what is happening. Here is a helpful tip sheet for recognizing stalking safety issues. An online tool called the Stalking and Harassment Assessment Risk Profile (SHARP) can help you get a better sense of your situation. It takes roughly 15-20 minutes to complete, is research-based and can help you determine next steps you may want to take to increase your safety.</p></div>

          <a href="#" class="accordion-title">How is Stalking Different from Harassment?</a> <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
            <p>Stalking can look like harassment at first but it’s actually different. Harassment involves unwanted contact that seriously annoys or alarms someone,  causes them emotional distress, and can involve a single incident.</p>
            <p>Stalking, on the other hand, involves a pattern of repeated unwanted behavior (two or more incidents) committed over time that causes fear. If you feel you are being harassed, you can file for an Anti-harassment Order. The petition for an Anti-harassment Order and Stalking Protection Order are actually the same petition: the court will decide which type of order best fits your situation.</p></div>

          <a href="#" class="accordion-title">How is Stalking Different from Cyberstalking?</a> <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
            <p>Cyberstalking is a form of stalking but is its own crime under the law. Someone can stalk a person by using electronic devices and online technologies rather than physically or in person. Cyberstalking, sometimes called “online abuse,” occurs when an individual uses the internet or other electronic means to stalk or harass another person.</p>
            <p>Cyberstalking may include monitoring, threats, solicitation for sex, disclosing intimate images of someone, using social media or gathering information that may be used to threaten or harass. Cyberstalking is a crime that is indeed on the rise in the US as technology improves. If you are a victim of cyberstalking you may apply for a Stalking Protection Order.</p></div>

          <a href="#" class="accordion-title">What if my stalker is someone I’ve been in a relationship with, or a family member?</a> <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
            <p>It is important to note that you can be stalked by a spouse, intimate partner, or ex-partner. However, if you are being stalked by a spouse or intimate partner, or someone you date or used to date, or someone with whom you have a child, a roommate or former roommate, or a family member, you should seek protection in the form of a Domestic Violence Protection Order. Please visit Protectionorder.org for more information and assistance.</p></div>

          <a href="#" class="accordion-title">What about Bullying?</a> <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
            <p>Bullying is a type of harassment, commonly seen in school settings or with young people that can involve in-person or electronic intimidation, cruel teasing, humiliation and threats. It can be repeated, like stalking, or it may only occur one time. If the bullying you are experiencing is causing you distress, you may consider filing for an Anti-harassment Order, or if the behavior is repeated or part of a pattern causing fear, you may consider filing for a Stalking Protection Order. More information on bullying is available at https://www.stopbullying.gov/laws/washington.html</p></div>

      <h2>Why It's a Big Deal</h2>
      <h3>Stalking is a community concern.</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>7.5 million people are stalked in one year in the U.S. </li>
        <li>An estimated 15 percent of women and 6 percent of men have been a victim of stalking during their lifetimes</li>
        <li>61 percent of female victims and 44 percent of male victims were stalked by a current or former intimate partner</li>
        <li>25 of female victims and 32% of male victims are stalked by an acquaintance</li>
      </ul>
<p>People react in all sorts of ways to stalking, from minimizing it to experiencing much fear and stress. Being stalked can take a big toll on someone. It can lead a person to feel a loss of control over their life and a loss of their autonomy and privacy. Many experience high anxiety, distress and/ or fear, hypervigilance, worry that it’s never going to end or that no one else thinks it’s that serious. It can lead to health concerns, difficulty concentrating, time lost at work, and can create financial troubles.</p>
