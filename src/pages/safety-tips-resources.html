<p class="intro-text">
  If you think that you or someone you know is being stalked, we encourage you to follow the <strong>“STEPS”</strong> action plan created by stalking experts to engage in active and ongoing safety planning: </p>
<ul class="accordion" data-accordion data-multi-expand="true" data-allow-all-closed="true">

     <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
        <p>The <a href="http://www.cdar.uky.edu/CoerciveControl/sharp.html">Stalking and Harassment Risk Profile (SHARP)</a> can help with this step.

      <a href="#" class="accordion-title"><h5><u>T</u>hreat Assessment</h5></a>
      <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
        <p>Do not minimize or downplay the level of risk involved with stalking behavior. Stalking can be a “red flag” for increased violence, psychological harm or life sabotage. Risk can be increased if the stalker has a mental health issue or illness. Risk also increases if the stalker’s behavior involves firearms or other dangerous weapons.</p>
        <p>Plan ahead for your safety by thinking about the specific threats you may face and vulnerabilities you may have. Think ahead about what you can do in specific situations, particularly if the stalker shows up unexpectedly, so that you can be prepared. Practice things you might say or do to avoid or escape a dangerous situation. Ask people you trust to watch out for you and help you stay safe.</p>
      </div>

    <li class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>
      <a href="#" class="accordion-title"><h5><u>E</u>vidence</h5></a>
        <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
            <p>Document the stalking behaviors and preserve evidence. If law enforcement or the courts were to ever get involved, documenting the stalking can help highlight the pattern of behavior, and show that the behavior is deliberate and intentional. Whether or not you choose to petition for a Stalking Protection Order, documenting the stalking behavior is strongly recommended.</p>

      <a href="#" class="accordion-title"> <h5><u>P</u>rotection</h5></a>
        <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
          <p>People who are being stalked must be active and ongoing in their safety planning, which can sometimes mean making changes in lifestyle, daily routines or living situation. It is important to be clear with the stalker that the harassment and stalking is unwanted. Document how the stalker was notified that their contact is not wanted and should stop. Law enforcement may be able to help communicate this request, or a stalking protection order  may be a helpful protective measure. Then avoid contact with the stalker as much as possible.</p>

    <a href="#" class="accordion-title"> <h5><u>S</u>upport</h5></a>
        <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
          <p>It is really important to seek support. Telling trusted others like friends, family, teachers, employers and neighbors what is happening can provide emotional support and help with thinking through safety measures. Consider notifying law enforcement to see what kind of support and assistance they can offer.</p>

<h2>Preserving Evidence</h2>
<h3 i>Documenting Stalking Incidents and Behavior</h3>

<p>Whether or not you choose to petition for a Stalking Protection Order, documenting the stalking behavior is strongly recommended. Because stalking involves multiple incidents, it is important to document each incident of stalking behavior in as much detail as possible, including details such as date, time and location of each incident; what happened; vehicle and license plate information; witnesses; how the behavior affected you and changes you had to make in your life as a result. <a href="https://www.outrageus.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Tracking-the-Stalker-Documentation.pdf">Tracking the Stalker</a> tips and a <a href="http://www.victimsofcrime.org/docs/src/stalking-incident-log_pdf.pdf?sfvrsn=4" >stalking incident log</a> can be helpful for detailing each incident. </p>

<p>Often stalking logs are helpful in making police reports and can become evidence in a stalking case. IT IS IMPORTANT <em>not</em> to include any new personal information that the stalker could learn in your stalking incident log. If the log were to become evidence in a criminal case, it would be made part of a public record and the stalker would likely be allowed to review the log as part of the discovery process. Do not record information you want to remain confidential.
</p>

<h4>TIPS for documenting stalking:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Call the police to report each incident of stalking and/or violations of a protection order.</li>
  <li>Take a picture of each police incident report or the patrol officer’s card. This will be helpful for any follow-up police work that may be needed.</li>
  <li>Keep all text messages, emails and voicemail messages from the stalker. Do not delete this important electronic evidence!</li>
  <li>If you receive unwanted mail or gifts, save everything for possible follow-up and collection by law enforcement.</li>
  <li>If the stalking involved unwanted social media contact, do not immediately delete your accounts. Contact the police for assistance in collecting the evidence. You may want to take a screen shot of each contact.</li>
  <li>If you receive unwanted phone calls, document how many calls you receive and the time of the calls.</li>
  <li>If family members or friends are also being harassed or have witnessed stalking incidents, document the witnesses’ names and times of contact. Ask witnesses to document their version of the incident and consider giving their statement to law enforcement if necessary.</li>
  <li>If your property (car or home) are being vandalized/damaged, take pictures of the damaged property and call the police.</li>
